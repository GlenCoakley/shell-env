==> Pouring sqlite-3.30.1.mojave.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
sqlite is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /Users/glencoakley,
because macOS provides an older sqlite3.

If you need to have sqlite first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/Users/glencoakley/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find sqlite you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/Users/glencoakley/opt/sqlite/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/glencoakley/opt/sqlite/include"

For pkg-config to find sqlite you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/Users/glencoakley/opt/sqlite/lib/pkgconfig"
