==> Caveats
==> openssl@1.1
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /Users/glencoakley/etc/openssl@1.1/certs

and run
  /Users/glencoakley/opt/openssl@1.1/bin/c_rehash

openssl@1.1 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /Users/glencoakley,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@1.1 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/Users/glencoakley/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/Users/glencoakley/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/glencoakley/opt/openssl@1.1/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/Users/glencoakley/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"

==> readline
readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /Users/glencoakley,
because macOS provides BSD libedit.

For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/Users/glencoakley/opt/readline/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/glencoakley/opt/readline/include"

For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/Users/glencoakley/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"

==> python
Python has been installed as
  /Users/glencoakley/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /Users/glencoakley/opt/python/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /Users/glencoakley/lib/python3.7/site-packages
